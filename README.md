# Estimating On-Farm Genotypic Performance and Variability Using Ranking Data

This repository contains functions for quantitative genetic analysis of ranking data, developed in R. The tools here are designed to help researchers estimate genotypic performance, genotypic variance, and heritability from on-farm trials using ranking-based evaluations.

## Features
- Estimate genotypic values from ranking data.
- Calculate genotypic variance and heritability.
- Implement models such as Thurstonian and Plackett-Luce for ranking data.
- Designed for on-farm trials in plant breeding programs.
